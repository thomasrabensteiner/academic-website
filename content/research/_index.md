Wages across occupations have substantially diverged in Western Europe, exacerbating wage inequality. This paper presents a novel perspective on this divergence by identifying occupational autonomy as a crucial determinant of wage growth.


<!--Wages across occupations have substantially diverged in Western Europe, exacerbating wage inequality. This paper presents a novel perspective on this divergence by identifying occupational autonomy as a crucial determinant of wage growth. We analyse individual-level wage data from the EU Survey of Income and Living Conditions across 15 Western European countries from 2003 to 2018 and reveal that occupations with higher autonomy have experienced markedly faster wage growth compared to those with lower autonomy, thereby increasing the autonomy wage premium. Our analysis indicates that the rise in the autonomy premium is more pronounced in countries and industries where employee monitoring and outsourcing are widespread. These findings imply that recent socio-economic shifts are not power-neutral but have eroded the bargaining power of workers in low-autonomy occupations. Conversely, rising minimum wages mitigate the rise in the autonomy premium.-->
